  ## Description
  This project utlizes the Model View Controller structure and incorporates Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars to create an interactive application that allows   the user to search through the catalog of an online record store. They have the option to view album information provided by the Discogs API and add their           favorite albums to their own crate with the use of sequelize and api routes. This project also features login/logout capabilities with the use of express-           sessions. The interface is fully responsive with help of Bootstrap and sesitive information is protected with a .env file.
